### Missing Planned Documentation (7 files)

Per docs/MIGRATION.md, these files are planned but not created:
- docs/advanced-features/smart-learning.md
- docs/advanced-features/automation-advanced.md
- docs/technical/services-api.md
- docs/technical/architecture.md
- docs/technical/configuration.md
- docs/examples/configurations/* (directory doesn't exist)
- docs/examples/automations/* (directory doesn't exist)

## 2. Content Overlap Analysis

### Critical Redundancies Identified

#### A. Installation Instructions (40% overlap)
**Duplicated across 4 files:**
- README.md (lines 128-142): Quick installation steps
- docs/installation/quickstart.md (lines 7-25): Same HACS/manual install steps
- docs/installation/complete-guide.md (lines 7-25): Repeats basic install before AppDaemon
- docs/user-guides/getting-started.md (references but doesn't repeat)

**Recommendation**: Consolidate to single source of truth in quickstart.md, others should link

#### B. Entity Documentation (25% overlap)
**Duplicated information:**
- README.md: Brief entity overview
- docs/technical/entity-reference.md: Complete reference
- docs/user-guides/getting-started.md: Subset of key entities
- docs/user-guides/daily-operation.md: Another subset with usage context

**Recommendation**: Keep full reference in entity-reference.md, create targeted subsets for guides

#### C. Phase Cycle Explanation (35% overlap)
**Repeated in 5 locations:**
- README.md (lines 53-67): Brief overview
- docs/user-guides/getting-started.md (lines 64-117): Detailed explanation
- docs/user-guides/daily-operation.md: Operational perspective
- docs/installation/complete-guide.md (lines 121-155): Configuration perspective
- SMART_LEARNING_SETUP.md: References phases

**Recommendation**: Create single authoritative explanation, link from others

#### D. Troubleshooting Content (30% overlap)
**Scattered across:**
- docs/user-guides/troubleshooting.md: Main comprehensive guide
- Each installation guide has "Quick Fixes" section
- README.md has support section
- getting-started.md has "First Steps" troubleshooting

**Recommendation**: Centralize in troubleshooting.md with quick-reference cards elsewhere

#### E. Hardware Setup (20% overlap)
**Duplicated between:**
- docs/installation/hardware-setup.md: Dedicated guide
- docs/installation/complete-guide.md (lines 71-105): Partial hardware info
- docs/user-guides/getting-started.md: References hardware

**Recommendation**: Single hardware guide, others just link

## 3. User Journey Mapping Issues

### Current Navigation Problems

#### Problem 1: Multiple Entry Points
Users can start at:
- README.md → 3 different "experience levels"
- quickstart.md directly
- getting-started.md directly
- complete-guide.md directly

**Result**: Confusion about correct starting point

#### Problem 2: Circular References
- quickstart.md → suggests complete-guide.md → references quickstart.md
- getting-started.md → links to quickstart.md → links back to getting-started.md

#### Problem 3: Inconsistent Progression
- Some paths: quickstart → complete → advanced
- Other paths: getting-started → daily-operation → troubleshooting
- No clear "graduation" between levels

### Recommended User Journey

```
New User Entry
    ↓
1. README.md (Landing only - 200 words max)
    ↓
2. docs/installation/quickstart.md (Required first step)
    ↓
3. docs/user-guides/getting-started.md (Understanding system)
    ↓
4. CHOICE POINT:
    A. Manual Operation → daily-operation.md → dashboard-guide.md
    B. Full Automation → complete-guide.md → AppDaemon setup
    ↓
5. Advanced Features (optional):
    - llm-integration.md
    - smart-learning.md
    ↓
6. Reference (as needed):
    - entity-reference.md
    - troubleshooting.md
```

## 4. Technical Accuracy Issues

### Outdated Information Found

1. **SMART_LEARNING_SETUP.md**:
   - References old file paths that may not exist
   - Mentions "already configured in this repo" but apps.yaml may differ
   - Zone numbering inconsistent with main integration

2. **LLM Integration Costs**:
   - References "GPT-5" models that don't exist yet
   - Pricing appears speculative ($0.05-$1.25 per 1M tokens)
   - Should clarify actual available models

3. **Entity Names**:
   - Multiple naming conventions referenced
   - Some guides use old entity patterns
   - Inconsistent with actual integration output

4. **Migration Guide**:
   - References files that were "removed" but some still exist
   - SMART_LEARNING_SETUP.md marked for replacement but still present

### Broken References

- README.md links to non-existent:
  - docs/advanced-features/smart-learning.md
  - docs/advanced-features/automation-advanced.md
  - docs/technical/services-api.md
  - docs/technical/architecture.md
  - docs/technical/configuration.md
  - docs/examples/* (entire directory missing)

## 5. Information Architecture Assessment

### Current Structure Problems

1. **Unclear Hierarchy**:
   - Root level mixes project docs (README) with feature docs (SMART_LEARNING_SETUP)
   - Development docs in docs/development/ but CI/CD in .github/instructions/

2. **Inconsistent Categorization**:
   - "getting-started" in user-guides/ but "quickstart" in installation/
   - Hardware setup in installation/ but daily hardware checks in user-guides/

3. **Missing Logical Groups**:
   - No clear separation between required vs optional features
   - No distinction between one-time setup vs ongoing operation

### Recommended Architecture

## 6. Redundancy Elimination Strategy

### Files to Merge

1. **Merge Installation Guides**:
   - Combine quickstart.md + complete-guide.md → single progressive guide
   - Keep hardware-setup.md separate as reference

2. **Consolidate User Guides**:
   - Merge getting-started.md + first parts of daily-operation.md
   - Create clear operational guide from remainder

3. **Unify Feature Documentation**:
   - SMART_LEARNING_SETUP.md → merge into planned smart-learning.md
   - Ensure single source for each feature

### Files to Remove

1. **Redundant Files**:
   - docs/MIGRATION.md (after this cleanup)
   - Development issues in docs/development/ (move to GitHub issues)

2. **Outdated Content**:
   - SMART_LEARNING_SETUP.md (after merging into proper location)
   - Old changelog entries beyond last 3 versions

### Content to Consolidate

1. **Create Shared Includes**:
   - _includes/phase-cycle.md (single source)
   - _includes/entity-tables.md (key entities only)
   - _includes/safety-features.md

2. **Standardize Examples**:
   - Single location for YAML examples
   - Consistent service call format
   - Unified troubleshooting procedures

## 7. Gap Analysis
