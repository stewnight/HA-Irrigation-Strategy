# Smart Learning System Setup Guide

**Learning system for crop steering automation** that optimizes water delivery for each zone using existing pressure-compensating drippers without additional hardware.

> **Prerequisites**: Complete [installation guide](../user-guides/02-installation.md) with working automation before enabling learning features.

## üéØ What This System Does

### Intelligent Learning Features
- **Field Capacity Detection**: Discovers true saturation point for each zone
- **Efficiency Optimization**: Learns how much water each zone actually absorbs
- **Channeling Detection**: Identifies when water finds easy paths through substrate
- **Adaptive Shot Sizing**: Calculates optimal irrigation duration based on learned patterns
- **Zone Personalities**: Each zone learns its unique characteristics over time

### How It Works Without Flow Sensors
Your pressure-compensating drippers (1.2 L/hr each) provide **exact** water measurement:
- **Input Calculation**: `1.2 L/hr √ó 8 drippers √ó duration = precise delivery`
- **Efficiency Measurement**: `VWC change √∑ theoretical change = substrate efficiency` 
- **Field Capacity Detection**: `When efficiency drops below 30% = FC reached`

**This is more accurate than cheap flow sensors!**

## üìã Installation Steps

### Step 1: File Installation
```bash
# 1. Copy the learning system files to your AppDaemon apps directory
cp smart_irrigation_learning.py /config/appdaemon/apps/crop_steering/
cp learning_dashboard.py /config/appdaemon/apps/crop_steering/

# 2. Update your AppDaemon configuration
# Edit /config/appdaemon/apps/apps.yaml (already configured in this repo)

# 3. Restart AppDaemon
# Home Assistant ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Add-ons ‚Üí AppDaemon ‚Üí Restart
```

### Step 2: System Configuration
Edit the configuration in `apps.yaml` for your specific setup:

```yaml
smart_irrigation_learning:
  # ADJUST THESE VALUES FOR YOUR SYSTEM
  zones: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  # Your active zones
  dripper_rate: 1.2           # L/hr per dripper (confirm your specs)
  drippers_per_plant: 2       # Count your drippers
  plants_per_zone: 4          # Count your plants
  substrate_volume: 3.0       # Liters per plant (measure this!)
```

### Step 3: Verify Entity Names
Ensure your VWC sensor entity names match what the system expects:

**Expected Entity Names:**
```
sensor.crop_steering_zone_1_vwc  (preferred - from integration)
OR
sensor.zone_1_vwc_front and sensor.zone_1_vwc_back (fallback)
```

**If your entities are named differently**, edit the `get_zone_vwc()` function in the learning system to match your names.

## üöÄ First Run: Zone Characterization

### Phase 1: Field Capacity Detection (Week 1)

Run field capacity detection for each zone. This will take 20-60 minutes per zone:

#### Manual Service Calls
```yaml
# In Home Assistant Developer Tools ‚Üí Services
service: crop_steering.detect_field_capacity
data:
  zone_id: 1
```

#### Automatic Learning
The system runs daily learning routines at 6 AM. It will automatically detect field capacity for zones that don't have it yet.

#### What Happens During FC Detection
1. System delivers small water shots (30 seconds each)
2. Waits 2 minutes for absorption between shots
3. Measures VWC increase vs. water delivered
4. When efficiency drops below 30%, FC is reached
5. Stores FC value and efficiency curve in database

### Phase 2: Efficiency Characterization (Week 2)

After field capacity is known, characterize efficiency at different moisture levels:

```yaml
service: crop_steering.characterize_zone_efficiency
data:
  zone_id: 1
```

This takes 2-4 hours per zone but provides detailed efficiency curves for optimal shot sizing.

## üìä Dashboard Monitoring

### New Home Assistant Entities
The system creates monitoring entities for each zone:

```
sensor.crop_steering_zone_1_learning_status      # "learned" or "needs_learning"
sensor.crop_steering_zone_1_field_capacity       # FC percentage (e.g., 68.5%)
sensor.crop_steering_zone_1_avg_efficiency       # Recent efficiency average
sensor.crop_steering_zone_1_recommendation       # Current recommendation

sensor.crop_steering_learning_progress            # Overall system progress
sensor.crop_steering_total_irrigations_logged    # Total tracked irrigations
```

### Create Dashboard Cards
Add these to your Home Assistant dashboard:

```yaml
# Learning Progress Card
type: entities
title: Learning System Status
entities:
  - sensor.crop_steering_learning_progress
  - sensor.crop_steering_total_irrigations_logged

# Zone Intelligence Grid
type: grid
cards:
  - type: entities
    title: Zone 1 Intelligence
    entities:
      - sensor.crop_steering_zone_1_learning_status
      - sensor.crop_steering_zone_1_field_capacity
      - sensor.crop_steering_zone_1_avg_efficiency
      - sensor.crop_steering_zone_1_recommendation
  # Repeat for zones 2-6...
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "VWC sensor unavailable" errors
```python
# Check entity names in the get_zone_vwc() function
# Update to match your sensor naming:
avg_vwc = self.get_state(f"sensor.YOUR_ZONE_{zone_id}_vwc")
```

#### "Cannot execute irrigation" errors  
```python
# Verify your crop steering integration services are working
# Test manually first:
service: crop_steering.execute_irrigation_shot
data:
  zone: 1
  duration_seconds: 30
```

#### Learning takes too long
```yaml
# Adjust learning parameters in apps.yaml:
shot_test_duration: 15        # Shorter test shots
absorption_wait_time: 60      # Wait less between measurements
```

#### Database errors
```bash
# Check AppDaemon has write permission to create database
ls -la /config/appdaemon/apps/crop_steering/
# Should create: zone_intelligence.db
```

### Logs and Debugging
```bash
# Check AppDaemon logs
tail -f /config/appdaemon/appdaemon.log

# Look for learning system messages:
grep "Smart Irrigation Learning" /config/appdaemon/appdaemon.log
grep "Zone.*Field capacity" /config/appdaemon/appdaemon.log
```

## üíæ Database Information

The learning system creates a SQLite database at:
`/config/appdaemon/apps/crop_steering/zone_intelligence.db`

### Database Tables
- **`zone_profiles`**: Field capacity, efficiency curves, zone characteristics
- **`irrigation_log`**: Every irrigation with efficiency data
- **`learning_sessions`**: Learning activity tracking

### Backing Up Learning Data
```bash
# Backup your learned intelligence
cp /config/appdaemon/apps/crop_steering/zone_intelligence.db /config/backups/
```

---

## üîÑ Integration with Existing System

### Running Alongside Current Automation
The learning system can run alongside your existing master crop steering app:

```yaml
# In apps.yaml - both can be enabled:
smart_irrigation_learning:
  module: smart_irrigation_learning
  class: SmartIrrigationLearning

master_crop_steering:  # Your existing system
  module: crop_steering.master_crop_steering_app
  class: MasterCropSteeringApp
```

### Migration Path
1. **Phase 1**: Run learning system in monitoring mode (learn but don't control)
2. **Phase 2**: Use learned parameters in existing automation
3. **Phase 3**: Replace rule-based decisions with intelligent calculations
