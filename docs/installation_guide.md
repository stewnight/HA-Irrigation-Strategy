## 🎛️ System Configuration

### 🎯 Basic Configuration (Required)
The setup wizard will walk you through this:

**Zone Setup:**
- How many growing areas do you have? (1-6 zones)
- Each zone can have its own sensors and controls

**Hardware Mapping:**
- **Water Pump:** The entity that turns your pump on/off
- **Main Valve:** The solenoid that controls your main water line
- **Zone Valves:** Individual valves for each growing area

*Don't know your entity names?* Check Developer Tools → States

### 🌡️ Sensor Configuration (Optional)
For each zone, you can add:

**Moisture Monitoring:**
- **Front VWC Sensor:** Moisture sensor at front of growing area
- **Back VWC Sensor:** Second moisture sensor for better accuracy

**Nutrient Monitoring:**
- **Front EC Sensor:** Nutrient/salt level sensor at front
- **Back EC Sensor:** Second EC sensor for better accuracy

**Environmental Sensors (system-wide):**
- **Temperature Sensor:** Air temperature
- **Humidity Sensor:** Relative humidity
- **VPD Sensor:** Vapor Pressure Deficit (if available)

**💡 Pro Tip:** You can always add more sensors later by reconfiguring the integration

### Legacy Configuration (crop_steering.env)
If you have an existing setup, you can load from your crop_steering.env file by selecting "Load from file" during setup.

## ✅ Test Your Installation

### 🔍 Quick System Check

**1. Check Integration Status**
- Go to **Settings → Devices & Services**
- Look for **"Crop Steering System"** device
- Should show green "Connected" status
- Click on it to see all your zones

**2. Verify Entities Were Created**
- Go to **Developer Tools → States**
- Type **"crop_steering"** in the filter box
- You should see many entities like:
  - `sensor.crop_steering_current_phase`
  - `switch.crop_steering_system_enabled`
  - `switch.crop_steering_zone_1_enabled` (for each zone)
  - `number.crop_steering_p1_target_vwc`
  - And many more!

**3. Test Basic Control**
- Find `switch.crop_steering_system_enabled`
- Try turning it OFF and ON
- The state should change immediately

**4. Check AppDaemon (if installed)**
- Go to **Settings → Add-ons → AppDaemon 4**
- Click the **"Log"** tab
- Look for: `Master Crop Steering Application initialized`
- **If you see errors:** Double-check your token and configuration

### 🚨 Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

**Problem: "I don't see Crop Steering in Add Integration"**
- ✅ **Solution:** Restart Home Assistant and wait 2-3 minutes
- ✅ **Check:** Settings → System → Logs for any error messages

**Problem: "AppDaemon won't start or shows errors"**
- ✅ **Check your token:** Go to your Profile → Long-Lived Access Tokens
- ✅ **Verify URL:** Should be `http://192.168.1.XXX:8123` (use your HA IP)
- ✅ **Check timezone:** Must match your Home Assistant timezone
- ✅ **Remember:** The integration works fine without AppDaemon for manual control

**Problem: "I only see some of my zones"**
- ✅ **This is normal:** Entities are only created for the zones you configured
- ✅ **Want more zones?** Reconfigure the integration to add them

**Problem: "My sensors show 'Unknown' or 'None'"**
- ✅ **Check entity names:** Go to Developer Tools → States and verify your sensor entity names
- ✅ **Check sensor status:** Make sure your physical sensors are working
