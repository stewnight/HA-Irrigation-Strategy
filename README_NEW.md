## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

### The 4-Phase Irrigation Cycle

**P0 - Morning Dryback** (6:00-10:00 AM)
- Wait for natural moisture drop from overnight peak
- Monitor for target dryback percentage (typically 8-12%)
- Transition to P1 when dryback threshold reached

**P1 - Ramp-Up** (10:00 AM-12:00 PM)  
- Progressive irrigation shots (2-10% of pot volume)
- Gradually increase moisture to target levels
- Multiple small shots prevent overwatering

**P2 - Maintenance** (12:00 PM-6:00 PM)
- Threshold-based irrigation during peak light hours
- Maintain target VWC levels with EC ratio adjustments
- Most irrigation volume occurs during this phase

**P3 - Pre-Lights-Off** (6:00 PM-6:00 AM)
- Emergency-only irrigation to prevent plant stress
- Prepare plants for overnight rest period
- Minimal water usage to avoid root zone saturation
