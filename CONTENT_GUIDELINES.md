# Content Guidelines and Design Principles

## Overview
This document establishes the content standards, design principles, and maintenance guidelines for the HA-Irrigation-Strategy documentation system.

## Content Strategy Principles

### 1. Progressive Disclosure
**Principle:** Start simple, reveal complexity gradually
- **Entry points** focus on immediate value and quick wins
- **Depth available** for users who need advanced features
- **Clear transitions** between complexity levels
- **No overwhelming** new users with advanced concepts upfront

**Implementation:**
```markdown
# Guide Structure Template
## Quick Start (2 minutes)
Basic steps to get immediate results

## Complete Setup (15 minutes)  
Full configuration with all options

## Advanced Configuration (30+ minutes)
Power user features and customization

## Troubleshooting
Common issues and solutions
```

### 2. Single Source of Truth
**Principle:** Each concept has one authoritative explanation
- **Primary location** for each topic clearly designated
- **Cross-references** link to primary source
- **No duplication** of substantial content
- **Regular audits** to prevent content drift

**Implementation:**
- **Concept ownership:** Each major topic has a designated primary file
- **Link validation:** Automated checking of internal links
- **Content review:** Quarterly audits for duplication and accuracy
- **Update propagation:** Changes to primary source trigger review of references

### 3. User-Centric Organization
**Principle:** Structure follows user needs, not system architecture
- **Task-oriented** rather than feature-oriented organization
- **User journey** determines information sequence
- **Context-sensitive** help and next steps
- **Outcome-focused** rather than process-focused

### 4. Mobile-First Design
**Principle:** All content must work well on mobile devices
- **Concise sections** readable on small screens
- **Minimal horizontal scrolling** for code blocks and tables
- **Touch-friendly** navigation elements
- **Progressive enhancement** for desktop features

## Writing Standards

### Voice and Tone

**Voice Characteristics:**
- **Professional yet approachable:** Expert guidance without intimidation
- **Confident and helpful:** Assumes user success, provides clear guidance
- **Concise and precise:** Respect user's time, eliminate fluff
- **Encouraging:** Acknowledges complexity while building confidence

**Tone Variations by User Type:**
- **Beginners:** Patient, reassuring, step-by-step
- **Intermediate:** Efficient, focused on getting things done
- **Advanced:** Technical, comprehensive, assumes context

**Examples:**
```markdown
❌ "You might want to try configuring the pump entity if you feel comfortable"
✅ "Configure your pump entity to enable automated irrigation"

❌ "This is a very complex system with many features"  
✅ "This system provides professional crop steering with three setup options"

❌ "Don't worry if this seems hard"
✅ "This 15-minute setup gets you running quickly"
```

### Language Standards

**Clarity Guidelines:**
- **Active voice** preferred over passive voice
- **Present tense** for instructions and descriptions
- **Specific nouns** instead of vague pronouns
- **Common terms** preferred over technical jargon (with definitions)

**Technical Writing:**
- **Code blocks** for all commands, file paths, and configuration
- **Inline code** for entity names, service calls, and short technical terms
- **Prerequisites** clearly stated at beginning of procedures
- **Expected outcomes** described for verification steps

**Accessibility:**
- **Alt text** for all images and diagrams
- **Clear headings** that work with screen readers
- **Logical reading order** that works without visual formatting
- **Color-independent** information (don't rely only on color)

```

### Code Block Standards

**Configuration Examples:**
```yaml
# Always include comments explaining purpose
sensor:
  - platform: template
    sensors:
      crop_steering_example:
        friendly_name: "Crop Steering Example"
        value_template: "{{ states('sensor.vwc_front') }}"
```
